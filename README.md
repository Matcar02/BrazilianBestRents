# BrazilianBestRents
The repository contains some of the work done by me and 4 colleagues for a university project of the "data analysis for business" class. The project aims at identifying the best deals and strategies to take by rental agencies to maximise profits in the Brazilian House Market. On the other hand, We also analyzed good deals for mid-income households.
